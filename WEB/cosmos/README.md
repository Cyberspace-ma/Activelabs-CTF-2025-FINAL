### **Challenge Overview**

The challenge revolves around identifying weak passwords, bypassing a WAF, and successfully executing a Base64-encoded SQL injection. The goal is to retrieve a flag stored in the administrator account.

### **Step 1: Logging In**

1. **Start Point**:
    
    - On the challenge page, you see several cards. One of them is labeled "Cosmos," containing the following hint:
        
        > "The Cosmos project explores the universe's wonders, but during development, the password was accidentally exposed. When checked on Have I Been Pwned, it was found that 'This password has been seen 10,437,277 times before,' highlighting the critical need for strong password practices and vigilance."
        
    - This suggests that the username is `cosmos` and that the password is one of the most commonly used weak passwords.

1. **Testing Credentials**:
    
    - Based on the hint, try `cosmos:password` in the username and password, which works.
3. **Outcome**:
    
    - Upon successful login, a new menu item labeled **"cosmos"** appears in the header.

### **Step 2: Exploring the "cosmos" Path**

1. **Navigating the New Path**:
    
    - Clicking the "cosmos" link redirects you to a search page with a text input box. You can input queries, but any attempt at standard SQL injection or text-based queries fails due to the Web Application Firewall (WAF).

1. **Identifying the WAF Restriction**:
    
    - After several failed attempts, observe that only Base64-encoded inputs do not get blocked.
    - For example, if you input `U0VMRUNUIDEgRlJPTSB1c2VycyE=` (Base64 for `SELECT 1 FROM users!`), you get a response indicating that the query was processed.

### **Step 3: Bypassing the WAF**

1. **Encoding SQL Queries**:
    
    - To bypass the WAF, encode your SQL queries in Base64.
    - For example, encoding `SELECT username, password FROM users;` results in the Base64 string:  
        `U0VMRUNUIHVzZXJuYW1lLCBwYXNzd29yZCBGUk9NIHVzZXJzOw==`
2. **Testing Queries**:
    
    - When this Base64-encoded query is entered, the system processes it and returns the **username** and **password** for all users in the database.
3. **Outcome**:
    
    - The query outputs a table with user credentials. Notably, the table includes the **administrator** account and its password.

### **Step 4: Logging In as Administrator**

1. **Using Admin Credentials**:
    
    - Use the retrieved administrator username and password to log in to the admin portal.

1. **Flag Retrieval**:
    
    - Upon successful login, the flag is displayed.
