# Operation Talent Writeup

## Overview

On January 29, 2025, the FBI launched a major operation named **"Operation Talent"**, targeting and dismantling two notorious cybercrime forums. These forums were known for trading illicit tools, cracked software, and stolen data. They were allegedly run by two young individuals, and together, they served millions of users engaged in illegal activities.

The task in this challenge is to identify the names of the two forums involved in **Operation Talent** and the owners of those forums. Once you identify the forums and their owners, you will be able to form the correct flag.

## Solution Approach

### Step 1: Research the Operation Talent Details

We begin by researching **Operation Talent** and gathering details about the forums that were shut down. From available sources, we know that the two forums targeted in this operation were **Cracked.io** and **Nulled.to**, which were widely used in cybercrime activities.

1. **Cracked.io**: A forum known for trading cracked software, stolen data, and hacking tools.
2. **Nulled.to**: Another popular forum engaged in similar illicit activities.

### Step 2: Identify the Owners

Next, we need to identify the individuals who owned these forums. Through available information and public sources, the owners of these forums are as follows:

1. **Cracked.io**: The owner of Cracked.io is **Florian Marzahl**.
2. **Nulled.to**: The owner of Nulled.to is **Finn Alexander Grimpe**.

### Step 3: Construct the Flag

Now that we have the names of the two forums and their owners, we can construct the flag. The flag format is as follows:

```
CSP{forumname1_forumname2_ownerofforum1_ownerofforum2}
```

Using the details we've gathered:

- **forumname1**: cracked
- **forumname2**: nulled
- **ownerofforum1**: florianmarzahl
- **ownerofforum2**: finnalexandergrimpe

Thus, the final flag is:

**CSP{cracked_nulled_florianmarzahl_finnalexandergrimpe}**
